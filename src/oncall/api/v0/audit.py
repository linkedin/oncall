    Search audit log. Allows filtering based on a number of parameters,
    detailed below. Returns an entry in the audit log, including the name
    of the associated team, action owner, and action type, as well as a
    timestamp and the action context. The context tracks different data
    based on the action, which may be useful in investigating.
    Audit logs are tracked for the following actions:

    * admin_created
    * event_created
    * event_edited
    * roster_created
    * roster_edited
    * roster_user_added
    * roster_user_deleted
    * team_created
    * team_edited
    * event_deleted
    * event_swapped
    * roster_user_edited
    * team_deleted
    * admin_deleted
    * roster_deleted
    * event_substituted
